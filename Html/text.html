            <h4>Aim</h4>
            <p>This website was created to solve the problem many people
                pass through when watching movies.
                Manytimes people spends so much time on a movie but at the end
                fell dissapointed because the movie didn't end well. But with juptube
                You can read about the movie you wish to watch and also watch the trailers
                before watching it thereby reducing the pain of watching a meaningless movie.
            </p>
            <h4>Source of information</h4>
            <p>All the information rendered on this website was gotten from The Movie Database </p>
